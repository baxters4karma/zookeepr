# Zookeepr

## Description

For the Zoo Keepr application, the city has already created a front end for us to work with. When we finish building the back end (i.e., server), we'll connect it to the front-end code. This will allow the front end to make AJAX requests to our server, much like we've done in the past with server-side APIs.
